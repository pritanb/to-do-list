# Description
A project I used to learn the basics of web development and deploy my first application. 
I wanted to build myself a to-do list so I would actually use it to keep up with tasks. 

## Frameworks/Libaries Used:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Javascript 
  - React
  - Bootstrap
  
## Functionality
  1. *Task Creation*:  
    - Users should be able to add new tasks to the to-do list.  
    - Each task should have a title.  
    - Each task should have a description.  
  2. *Task Display*:  
    - The app should display the list of tasks.  
    - Each task should show its title and description.
  3. *Task Completion*:  
    - Users should be able to mark tasks as completed.  
    - Completed tasks should be visually distinguishable from active tasks.
  4. *Task Deletion*:  
    - Users should be able to delete tasks from the list.
  5. *Task Editing*:  
    - Users should be able to edit both the title and descriptions of tasks.
  6. *Persistence*:  
    - The app should store the tasks locally so that they persist across page reloads.  
    - Local storage is used for persistence.
